- - cot: The error is due to an unsupported data type for the input tensor. The input
      tensor has a data type of 'Int' which is not supported by the 'softmax_lastdim_kernel_impl'
      implementation. Therefore, the constraint to prevent the error is to ensure
      that the input tensor has a data type that is supported by the 'softmax_lastdim_kernel_impl'
      implementation.
