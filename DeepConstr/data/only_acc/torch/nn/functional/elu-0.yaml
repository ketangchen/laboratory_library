- - cot: The error is due to the input tensor having a data type of 'Long', which
      is not supported by the 'elu' function. To prevent this error, the input tensor
      should have a data type that is supported by the 'elu' function. The supported
      data types for the 'elu' function are usually floating-point types, such as
      'float32' or 'float64'.
