- - cot: 'From the error message, it''s clear that the dimensions of the two tensors
      `other` and `self` do not match. The dist function is expecting tensors of the
      same shape. In this case, the shape of the `self` tensor is (2, 2, 3, 2, 2,
      2, 2, 2, 2) and the shape of the `other` tensor is (7, 8, 8, 8). The error message
      indicates that the size of tensor a (2) must match the size of tensor b (8)
      at non-singleton dimension 8.


      The condition that will prevent this error is that the dimensions and shapes
      of the `other` and `self` tensors must be equal. This can be formulated as follows:'
