- - cot: The error is caused because the anchor, positive, and negative tensors have
      different numbers of dimensions. Let's see what the args were. The anchor tensor
      has 0 dimensions, the positive tensor has 5 dimensions, and the negative tensor
      has 7 dimensions. Therefore, the number of dimensions for anchor, positive,
      and negative tensors should be the same.
