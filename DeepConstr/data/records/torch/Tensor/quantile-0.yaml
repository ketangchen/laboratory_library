- - cot: Error is triggered due to an invalid interpolation method. The valid interpolation
      methods are 'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', and 'nearest'. As per the
      error message, the given interpolation method is 'YgFc', which is not among
      the valid methods. Hence, the condition to prevent this error would be to ensure
      that the interpolation method is one of the valid methods.
