      The shapes of ''x1'' and ''x2'' are (5,7,2,3,6,4,1) and (7,7,7,3,7,7,7) respectively.
      Broadcasting in tensor operations requires that the trailing dimensions of the
      tensors are either 1 or the same. So, for each dimension starting from the last,
      the size of the dimension in ''x1'' should be equal to the size of the dimension
      in ''x2'' or one of them should be 1. We start from the last dimension because
      broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore, the constraint that
