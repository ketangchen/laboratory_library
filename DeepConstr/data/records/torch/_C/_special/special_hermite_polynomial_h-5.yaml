- - cot: The error is triggered because we are attempting to resize a tensor that
      is not resizable. It appears that this 'out' tensor must match the shape of
      the operation result. In this operation, the result shape is likely based on
      the 'x' tensor's shape. Therefore, the 'out' tensor's rank and shape must match
      those of the 'x' tensor.
