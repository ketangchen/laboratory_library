- - cot: The error arises because the sigmoid_ function returns a float value, and
      we are trying to cast that float value to an integer type Tensor, which is not
      possible. The sigmoid_ function results in values between 0 and 1, which can't
      be properly represented as integers. Therefore, the dtype of self tensor should
      be float.
