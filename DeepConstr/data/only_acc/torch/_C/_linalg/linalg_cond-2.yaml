      ''fro'', ''nuc'', inf, -inf, 1, -1, 2, -2}. However, a value of 5 was provided.
      Therefore, Left : p which is the norm type should be corrected. It says that
      cannot be 5, so Op : !=, and Right : 5. Also, it should be one of the valid
      norm types, so Op : in, and Right : {None, ''fro'', ''nuc'', inf, -inf, 1, -1,
      2, -2}.'
