      What the args were? The shapes of ''x1'' and ''x2'' are not broadcastable. So,
      the constraint should be that for each dimension starting from the last, the
      size of the dimension in ''x1'' should be equal to the size of the dimension
      in ''x2'' or one of them should be 1. We start from the last dimension because
      broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore, we can revise the constraints
      as follows:'

- - cot: 'The error arises because it''s ambiguous to evaluate the truth value of
      an array with more than one element in numpy.greater function. The truth value
      of an array is ambiguous when there are multiple elements in the array, and
      it''s unclear whether the function should return True if any element is True
      (a.any()) or if all elements are True (a.all()). This is an inherent ambiguity
      in Python''s interpretation of truthiness for containers.


      In this case, numpy.greater() is expecting single values for arguments ''x1''
      and ''x2'', but got arrays instead. So, the input should be single values or
