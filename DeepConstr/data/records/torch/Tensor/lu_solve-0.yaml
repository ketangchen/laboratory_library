      A and B respectively. Therefore, the constraint should be that the shape of
      A and B must match in a way that they can perform the matrix multiplication

- - cot: The error occurs because the shape of the tensor LU_data is too large. Therefore,
      the constraint to prevent this error would be limiting the tensor shape. One
      possible constraint could be to limit the number of dimensions and the size
      of each dimension of the tensor LU_data. For example, we could limit the number
      of dimensions to a maximum of 3 and the size of each dimension to a maximum
      of 1000.
