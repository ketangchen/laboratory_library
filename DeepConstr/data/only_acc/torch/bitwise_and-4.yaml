- - cot: 'Based on the given runtime information, the error occurs because the function
      `torch.bitwise_and` does not support the ''Float'' data type. The `self` tensor
      has a data type of ''Float'' (Tensor<f32>) which is not compatible with the
      operation.


      To prevent the error, the `self` tensor should have a data type that is supported
      by the `torch.bitwise_and` function. The supported data types are ''half'',
      ''int16'', ''int32'', ''int64'', ''uint8'', ''uint16'', ''uint32'', ''uint64''.


      Therefore, the constraint to prevent the error is:'
