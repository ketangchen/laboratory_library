- - cot: The error is triggered because the input tensor and weight tensor have 0
      dimensions. However, both arguments need to be at least 1-dimensional for the
      matmul operation to work. To prevent this error, we can add a constraint that
      the number of dimensions of both input and weight tensors should be greater
      than or equal to 1.
