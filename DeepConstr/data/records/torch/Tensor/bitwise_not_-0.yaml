- - cot: 'Based on the given error message, the error arises because the function
      `torch.Tensor.bitwise_not_` does not support the ''Float'' datatype. The runtime
      information shows that the input tensor `self` has the dtype ''Float'' (f32).


      To prevent the error, the input tensor `self` should have a datatype that is
      one of the supported types for the `bitwise_not_` operation. These supported
      types include ''half'', ''int16'', ''int32'', ''int64'', ''uint8'', ''uint16'',
      ''uint32'', and ''uint64''.


      Therefore, the constraint that can prevent the error is:'
