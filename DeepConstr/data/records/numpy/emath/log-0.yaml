- - cot: The error is caused because the numpy.emath.log function is trying to evaluate
      the truth value of an array with more than one element. This is ambiguous as
      it is unclear whether the function should return True if any element is True
      or if all elements are True. Therefore, a condition to prevent this error would
      be to ensure that the input 'x' is not a multi-element array. Therefore, the
      condition should be
